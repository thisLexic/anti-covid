		Hello! I'm Ben. <br>
		I'm a college student. Over the quarantine, I made this site in the hopes that it could help frontliners get to work more easily. <br>
		This website is completely free to use for all PasaHeroes and Local Government Units. The cost of managing and running the website falls on my parents. For any companies or individuals who would like to support, kindly contact us at mypasahero@gmail.com
	</p>
	<p align="center">
		This website is operational but it is still in its infancy. Collaboration with the Local Government Units is necessary for it to grow. If you would like to try out this page, there are examples in "Sample Province" and "Sample City A" which have routes just to see how the website would function. If you find that the website may be useful, kindly contact your city or municipality if they would like to collaborate with us. For more information regarding the website, please see the Help and About section.
